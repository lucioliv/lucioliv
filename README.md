[Hi, welcome to my Github](https://github.com/lucioliv?tab=repositories) 👋 😺 🎉

My name's Luciana, but everyone calls me Lu or Luci.
I'm a blind girl. I like books 📚, chess ♟️ and music 🎹

I'm from an intergalactic place: [École 42 🌌 São Paulo 🇧🇷 ](https://www.42sp.org.br/)
I'm a cadet (42's student) 👩🏻‍💻, the first blind 🕶 cadet worldwide 🌎

I work with accessibility and UX based on [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) at [Sondery](https://sondery.com.br/).
I 💜 technology because it allowed me to be here. With coding I can go much further ✈️🚀
